# Pig

This is a code template for a Theory of Knowledge activity in which students use Python to encode a decision-making process, explore some ideas on how to define and evaluate a "good" or "best" decision, and consider whether such ideas can meaningfully be applied to decision making processes in the different areas of knowledge,

The activity is centered around the jepeordy dice game, [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)), in which players throw a six sided die to get points: after each throw, the player can decide to either end his turn and collect his winnings or throw the die to increase the winnings. If the player throws a one, however, he loses all the winnings and must end his turn.

Students are tasked to complete the function template


Students' functions are then pitted against each other in an arena and ranked by the most significant wins.
