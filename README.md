# Pig TOK Activity

This is a code template for a Theory of Knowledge activity in which students use Python to encode a decision-making process, explore some ideas on how to define and evaluate a "good" or "best" decision, and consider the extent to which such ideas can meaningfully be applied to decision making processes in the different areas of knowledge.

The activity is centered around the jeopardy dice game, [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)), in which players throw a six sided die to get loot: after each throw, the player can decide to either end his turn and add the loot to his score or throw the die to increase the winnings. If the player throws a one, however, he loses all the winnings and must end his turn.

Students are tasked to complete the function template:

    def <function-name>(my_score, loot, your_score):
        """Function description"""
        # Your code goes here: return True to continue
        # throwing, False to take the loot.


Students' functions are then pitted against each other in an arena and ranked according to the most significant wins against the other students' functions.
